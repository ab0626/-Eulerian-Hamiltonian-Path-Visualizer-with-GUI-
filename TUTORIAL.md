# Graph Theory Visualizer Tutorial
## Following Robin J. Wilson's Educational Approach

Welcome to the Graph Theory Visualizer! This tutorial will guide you through the fundamental concepts of graph theory using an interactive, visual approach inspired by Robin J. Wilson's "Introduction to Graph Theory."

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Philosophy

This tool follows Wilson's educational principles:
- **Visual Learning**: See concepts rather than just read about them
- **Interactive Exploration**: Learn by doing and experimenting
- **Progressive Complexity**: Start simple, build understanding gradually
- **Conceptual Understanding**: Focus on intuition over formalism

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Application
```bash
# Basic version
python main.py

# Enhanced version with detailed analysis
python enhanced_main.py
```

## ðŸ“š Learning Progression (6 Stages)

### Stage 1: Graph Basics
**Goal**: Understand the fundamental building blocks of graphs

**Key Concepts**:
- **Vertices (Nodes)**: Points in the graph
- **Edges**: Lines connecting vertices
- **Degree**: Number of edges connected to a vertex

**Activities**:
1. Click "Add Vertex Mode" and add some vertices to the canvas
2. Click "Add Edge Mode" and connect vertices with edges
3. Observe how the graph properties panel updates in real-time
4. Try the "Simple Cycle" example to see a basic graph structure

**Wilson's Insight**: "Graphs are simply collections of points (vertices) connected by lines (edges). The power comes from the relationships these connections represent."

### Stage 2: Connectivity
**Goal**: Understand how graphs can be connected or disconnected

**Key Concepts**:
- **Connected Graph**: Every vertex can be reached from every other vertex
- **Components**: Separate pieces of a disconnected graph
- **Articulation Points**: Vertices whose removal disconnects the graph

**Activities**:
1. Create a connected graph and observe the "Connected: True" property
2. Try the "Disconnected Graph" example to see multiple components
3. Use "Analyze Connectivity" to get detailed information
4. Experiment with removing edges to create disconnected graphs

**Wilson's Insight**: "Connectivity is fundamental - it tells us whether a graph is 'in one piece' or has separate components."

### Stage 3: Special Structures
**Goal**: Explore fundamental graph structures like trees and cycles

**Key Concepts**:
- **Trees**: Connected graphs with no cycles
- **Cycles**: Paths that return to the starting vertex
- **Leaves**: Vertices with degree 1 (in trees)

**Activities**:
1. Load the "Tree" example and observe its structure
2. Use "Analyze Tree Properties" to see detailed tree characteristics
3. Notice how trees have exactly n-1 edges for n vertices
4. Try adding edges to a tree to create cycles

**Wilson's Insight**: "Trees are the 'skeleton' of connected graphs - remove edges from any connected graph and you get a tree."

### Stage 4: Eulerian Paths
**Goal**: Understand paths that traverse every edge exactly once

**Key Concepts**:
- **Eulerian Path**: Traverses every edge exactly once
- **Eulerian Cycle**: Eulerian path that returns to start
- **Degree Conditions**: All vertices must have even degree (cycle) or exactly two odd degree (path)

**Activities**:
1. Load the "Eulerian Graph" example
2. Use "Analyze Eulerian Properties" to understand the conditions
3. Click "Find Eulerian Path" to see the actual path highlighted
4. Experiment with different graph structures to see when Eulerian paths exist

**Wilson's Insight**: "Euler solved the KÃ¶nigsberg bridge problem by realizing that the key is the number of edges meeting at each landmass."

### Stage 5: Hamiltonian Paths
**Goal**: Explore paths that visit every vertex exactly once

**Key Concepts**:
- **Hamiltonian Path**: Visits every vertex exactly once
- **Hamiltonian Cycle**: Hamiltonian path that returns to start
- **NP-Complete**: No efficient general solution exists

**Activities**:
1. Load the "Hamiltonian Graph" example
2. Use "Analyze Hamiltonian Properties" to see the complexity
3. Try "Find Hamiltonian Path" to see if one exists
4. Experiment with different graphs to understand the difficulty

**Wilson's Insight**: "Unlike Eulerian paths, there's no simple condition to determine if a Hamiltonian path exists. This is a much harder problem!"

### Stage 6: Advanced Concepts
**Goal**: Explore more advanced graph theory concepts

**Key Concepts**:
- **Planarity**: Can the graph be drawn without edge crossings?
- **Graph Coloring**: Assigning colors to vertices with constraints
- **Matching**: Finding sets of edges with no shared vertices

**Activities**:
1. Load the "Non-planar (K5)" example to see a non-planar graph
2. Observe how edges must cross in K5
3. Experiment with different graph layouts
4. Explore the relationship between planarity and graph structure

## ðŸ”¬ Understanding the Algorithms

### Eulerian Path Algorithm (Hierholzer's)
1. Check if graph is connected
2. Count odd-degree vertices
3. If 0 odd-degree vertices: Eulerian cycle exists
4. If 2 odd-degree vertices: Eulerian path exists
5. Use Hierholzer's algorithm to find the actual path

### Hamiltonian Path Algorithm
1. For small graphs (â‰¤8 vertices): exhaustive search
2. Check necessary conditions (Dirac's theorem, Ore's theorem)
3. Try all possible vertex permutations
4. Verify if permutation forms a valid path/cycle

2. Find connected components if disconnected
3. Identify articulation points in connected graphs
4. Provide educational explanations for each result

- Paths are highlighted in real-time
- Properties are shown alongside the visual representation

### 2. Progressive Learning
